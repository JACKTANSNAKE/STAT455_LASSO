# Introduction:
The ordinary least squared model 
$$Y = \beta_0+\beta_1X_1+\beta_2X_2+...+\beta_nX_n+\epsilon_i$$
is the mostly commonly used method to describe the relationship between the response variable Y and a set of variables X. However, the OLS model is not perfect and it faces two major criticism. First, the OLS model usually has low prediction accuracy because it often has large variance and low bias. The second weakness is efficient interpretation. If we have a dataset with large number of predictors, we would usually choose a small subset of predictors which are strongly associated with the response variable; thus, it seems to be a loss that we still include the weak predictors in our model. However, the linear regression model is easy to regress and interpret; therefore, we would still use linear regression method but we want to modify it in a way such that we could have higher prediction accuracy and stronger interpretation.

There are several solutions proposed by the statisticians. The first method is subset selection which is a discrete selection process. Assuming that we have p predictors, and we would build $2^p$ models to find the most predictive models within all possible combinations. However, if we have a dataset with only 10 predictors, we would have to construct 1024 models. Therefore, the subset selection is computationally inefficient. The second method is shrinkage, including ridge and lasso regression. This approach shrinks the coefficients towards zero which is a continuous selection process. The continuous selection process is less variable than the subset selection because subset selection can yield a different model if there is a small change in the dataset. Therefore, we want to use the coefficients shrinkage method to find the best model under the concept of linear regression. In the following sections, we would discuss the definition, application, Bayesian interpretation, and limitations for both ridge and lasso regression. 



#Definition:
Recall that the ordinary least squared model estimates coefficients with the goal of minimizing the sum of the squared residuals:
$$RSS = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \beta_0-\sum_{j=1}^p\beta_jx_{ij})^2$$
Since the shrinkage approach takes into account of variable selection, the ridge regression estimates the coefficients that minimizes the combination of RSS and sum of the squared coefficients: 

##Ridge Regression:
$$
\hat{\beta^{ridge}} = arg\min_\beta\{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}(y_i - \beta_0 - \sum_{j = 1}^{p}x_{ij}\beta_j)^2 + \lambda\sum_{j = 1}^{p}\beta_j^2\} \ \ \ (1)
$$
Which is the same as:
$$
\hat{\beta^{ridge}} = arg\min_\beta\{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}(y_i - \beta_0 - \sum_{j = 1}^{p}x_{ij}\beta_j)^2\}\\
\text{subject to} \sum_{j = 1}^{p}\beta_j^2 \leq t
$$
where there is a one-to-one corresondence between the parameters $\lambda$ and $t$.




##Lasso Regression:
$$
\hat{\beta^{Lasso}} = arg\min_\beta\{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}(y_i - \beta_0 - \sum_{j = 1}^{p}x_{ij}\beta_j)^2 + \lambda\sum_{j = 1}^{p}\rvert\beta_j\rvert\} \ \ \ (1)
$$
Which is the same as:
$$
\hat{\beta^{Lasso}} = arg\min_\beta\{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}(y_i - \beta_0 - \sum_{j = 1}^{p}x_{ij}\beta_j)^2\}\\
\text{subject to} \sum_{j = 1}^{p}\rvert\beta_j\rvert \leq t
$$



# How does the shrinkage work
Now suppose that we have a dataset with 2 features. We first train a liner model for the data, and suppose $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are the coefficients for the two features. Thus by the definition of the ridge regression constraint, we have:
$$
\beta_1^2 + \beta_2^2 \leq t
$$
Similarly, for the Lasso regression contraint, we have:
$$
\rvert\beta_1\rvert + \rvert\beta_2\rvert \leq t
$$
